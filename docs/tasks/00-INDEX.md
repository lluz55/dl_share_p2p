# Task Index — P2P File Share

> Source of truth is always [`../../SPEC.md`](../../SPEC.md). These task files
> decompose the spec into self-contained units of work for LLM agents. If a task
> and the SPEC ever disagree, the SPEC wins — fix the task, raise the conflict.

## How to use these tasks

- Pick the lowest-numbered task whose dependencies are all `Done`.
- Each task file is self-contained: it restates the constraints it needs, but you
  MUST still treat SPEC.md `MUST`/`MUST NOT` as binding.
- Do **not** pull work from a later phase into an earlier one (SPEC §10).
- Do **not** invent technologies/transports not in SPEC §2 (SPEC §0 rule 2).
- If something is ambiguous, check SPEC §11 (Open Questions). Do not guess.
- When you finish a task, update its `Status` and note any SPEC changes made.

## Conventions

- Repo root layout follows SPEC §5. (Spec shows a `p2pshare/` wrapper; in this
  repo the project lives at the repository root — `server/`, `web/`, `flake.nix`
  sit next to `SPEC.md`.)
- Backend: Go. Frontend: vanilla TypeScript + esbuild. No frontend framework.
- The Go WebSocket data relay (SPEC §4.3) is NEVER called "TURN" in code or
  identifiers (SPEC §3.1 terminology note).

## Phase gating (SPEC §10)

- **Phase 1** (tasks 01–08): core transport + essential safeguards. Current scope.
- **Phase 2** (09–10), **Phase 3** (11–12): start only after Phase 1 is Done.
- **Phase 4** (13–14): conditional. Task 14 may proceed only after task 13
  resolves SPEC §11.1 and the SPEC is updated.
